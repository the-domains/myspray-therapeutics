**MySpray Therapeutics(r)**

MySpray provides a revolutionary way for you to
easily obtain the nutrition you need by offering our supplements in an oral
spray delivery system, allowing the highest
available absorption through sublingual and buccal diffusion. No
more difficult pills to swallow, drops to count or countless capsules every
day. These great tasting supplements are simply sprayed into the mouth and have
advantages over all supplemental forms.

****

****Revolutionary Absorption

In the case of MySpray(r) vitamins the
active components are already in solution or suspension; in other words, the
nutrient is already dissolved and just waiting to be absorbed into your system.

Revolutionary
Convenience

************

MySpray(r) will easily fit in your purse, pocket or briefcase. There is no need
to look for a glass of water to take a tablet or to measure spoonsful of liquid
or powder into water, or count drops.

Revolutionary Delivery

MySpray(r) gives a precise,
metered dose of product with every pump, which allows you to feel secure that
you are receiving the correct dose with each and every spray

Revolutionary Formulations

MySpray(r) formulations contain flavours
that are natural mints or fruit and Xylitol (known for cavity protection and is
diabetic safe). They do not contain GMOs, artificial flavours or colours, sugar,
starch, wheat, soy, gluten, eggs, salt, dairy or nuts.

****

**It
is our mission to revolutionize health products, through a convenient and
highly absorbable delivery system.**
